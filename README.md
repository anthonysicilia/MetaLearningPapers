# MetaLearningPapers
A collection of meta-learning papers with accompanying pdfs with accompanying bib file. This collection is seeded from papers listed in the survey "Meta-Learning: A Survey" by Joaquin Vanschoren, but I will slowly add more papers in meta-learning as I find them. I will also start grouping the papers (into folders) as I work through them. 

The .bib file should contain a reference to each paper and each paper should be named according to this reference.
